                <p>
                    CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named
                    Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late
                    with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles
                    that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might
                    have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed
                    course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy
                    that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the
                    speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.
                </p>
                <p>If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look
                    uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning
                    would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing,
                    but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.</p>
                <p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a
                    double box around it.</p>
                <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen 
                    the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as 
                    inflation, looked right.</p>
                <p>Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="#">the first sliver of cosmic time</a> with 
                    telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the 
                    Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time 
                    — so-called <a href="#">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a universe being wrenched 
                    violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. 
                    They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his 
                    colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.</p>
                <p>Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, 
                    wondered whether it could ever be proved.</p>
                <p>If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the 
                    recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. 
                    It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.</p>
                <p>Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion 
                    light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal 
                    patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, 
                    beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling 
                    into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.</p>
                <h6>'As Big as It Gets'</h6>
                <p>In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies 
                    forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights 
                    into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of 
                    gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, 
                    should ruffle space-time.</p>
                <p>Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was 
                    not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”</p>
                <p>He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram 
                    encoded in gravitational waves.”</p>
                <p>The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave 
                    radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 
                    380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.</p>
                <p>Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background 
                    Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific 
                    briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted 
                    to The Astrophysical Journal.</p>

                    <h6>The Theory of Inflation</h6>
                    <p>Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains 
                        how the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the instant after the Big 
                        Bang 13.8 billion years ago.</p>

                <div class="box text-1">
                    <p><strong>THE UNIVERSE</strong> is just under 14 billion years old. From our position 
                        in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion 
                        light-years across. But there's a mystery. Wherever we look, the universe has an 
                        even temperature.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="box text-2">
                    <p><strong>NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong> The universe is not old enough for light to have 
                        traveled the vast distance from one side of the universe to the other, and there 
                        has not been enough time for scattered patches of hot and cold to mix into an even 
                        temperature.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="box text-3">
                    <p><strong>DISTANT COFFEE</strong> At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look 
                        a mile in one direction. You see a coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can 
                        estimate its temperature and how much it has cooled.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="box text-4">
                    <p><strong>COFFEE EVERYWHERE</strong> Now turn around and look a mile in the other 
                        direction. You see a similar coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? 
                        Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every direction, you might want to look for another 
                        explanation.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="box text-5">
                    <p><strong>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong> There has not been enough time to carry coffee 
                        cups from place to place before they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow 
                        filled from a single coffee pot, all at the same time, that might explain their even 
                        temperature.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="box text-6">
                    <p><strong>INFLATION</strong> solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than 
                        a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the 
                        speed of light. Tiny ripples in the violently expanding energy field eventually grew 
                        into the large-scale structures of the universe.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="box text-7">
                    <p><strong>FLUCTUATION</strong>Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient 
                        fluctuations in swirls of polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which 
                        is energy left over from the early universe. These are gravitational waves predicted 
                        by Einstein.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="box text-8">
                    <p><strong>EXPANSION</strong>Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot expanding 
                        faster than light and cooling to an even temperature as it expands. That is something 
                        like inflation. And the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the 
                        original pot.</p>

            <div>
                <p>Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in
                    10 million.</p>
                <p>Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected
                    such a definite confirmation in his lifetime.</p>
