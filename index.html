                        CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named 
                        Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late 
                        with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
                </p>
                <p>
                        He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles 
                        that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might 
                        have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed 
                        course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy 
                        that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the 
                        speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.

                <p>Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 
                    10 million.</p>
                <p>Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected 
                    such a definite confirmation in his lifetime.</p>
